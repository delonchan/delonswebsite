    <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Remember all the &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; startups?</strong><br />A few years ago a ton of &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; startups got funded, but very few of them &ndash; maybe none? &ndash; worked out. It sounds good but ultimately most failed on the supply side. Let&rsquo;s explore why.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rideshare has better economics, at the same acquisition cost</strong><br />Rideshare is special. Acquiring a broad base of labor for driving is expensive, often $300+. But then they can get requests all day. You can work 20 hours and even 50 hours a week if you want. You continually need the driver app to find new customers</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Where a lot of &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; companies fall down &ndash; valet parking, car washing, massages, etc &ndash; is that demand is often infrequent and there&rsquo;s spikes at a few points in the day. What&rsquo;s your supply side supposed to do the rest of the time?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; cos often have the same cost of acquisition and cost of labor as rideshare, but can&rsquo;t fill their time with work as smoothly / profitably</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marketplace outcomes are sensitive to unit economics</strong><br />Rideshare networks are fickle and require a long period of being unit economic negative before they can break even, with enough scale/density. But a lot of &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; cos can never dig out of that hole, and stay unprofitable forever</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m bearish on food delivery as a stand-alone business in the long run. Uber can tap into their supply side and augment with food delivery earnings. Pure food companies have to get the same drivers but can&rsquo;t pay as well</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The key is to go for a different pool of workers</strong><br />So what kind of &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; ideas can work? Ultimately the ones that go for a completely different pool of labor. Folks who prefer to work from home. People who don&rsquo;t live near a city with rideshare. People who don&rsquo;t own cars. Etc.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you can find a different pool of labor, they still have the same motivations around flexible schedules and easy earning potential. You can use the same techniques as Uber &ndash; simple UX, transparent pricing, etc &ndash; and apply them to these marketplace opportunities</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In that way, the lessons from &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; are a subset of best practices you can learn from marketplaces. You need a strong strategy to get the supply/demand flywheel going. A big market with a defensible moat. Fragmentation that can be solved w transparency and aggregation</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don&rsquo;t emulate &ndash; approach from first principles, starting from the workers&rsquo; POV</strong><br />IMHO &ldquo;Uber for x&rdquo; cos failed to become a thing because they sought to emulate ridesharing when they should have just approached their particular market from first principles. There&rsquo;s still a ton of marketplace opportunities out there and am excited to see what people do!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Because all these marketplaces tend towards supply constrained, you should evaluate each opportunity/company from the POV of the supply side. Does it work for them? Can they do it 40 hours/week and stay sticky? When can you pull away subsidies? These are the key questions</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The key lesson!</strong><br />Supply side is ðŸ‘‘<span>&nbsp;</span>.</p>
