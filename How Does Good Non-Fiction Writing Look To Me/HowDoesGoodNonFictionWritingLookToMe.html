        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever read something and said to yourself, "Wow! What a great read. I thoroughly enjoyed what I've just read."?&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having had the great fortune of reading several excellent publications*, I decided to identify what draws me to those writings. What are the similarities? How are they structured? What makes them excellent? By identifying these traits, I hope to build my analysing muscle. Ultimately, by identifying features of good writing, I hope to improve my writing skills too.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px">*Publication refers to articles, blog posts, or any non-fiction literary work</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every publication has its own goal. You want your readers to either be informed, inspired, or entertained. Good writing does that.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After analysing a few of my favourite publications and reading books on writing, I've identified five traits that good writing has.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Good writing:</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has a captivating introduction.</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprises you</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makes you think</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is easy to read</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makes it easy to spread the message</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><br /><br /></p>
        <p><strong>Has a captivating introduction.</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve your goal of informing, inspiring, or entertaining through writing, you first have to get them to want to read the publication. To do that, you must captivate your readers. But to captivate your readers, your writing has to establish necessary contexts, be relatable, and be intriguing.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To establish necessary contexts, you have to set a scene that transports the reader vividly. In this blog post, it was the question of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Have you ever read something and said to yourself...". </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing context is like knowing what the weather of the day is going to be. By knowing the weather, you can prepare your outfit for the day accordingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People trust someone they know over strangers. And the quickest way to build rapport is through commonalities. So in your writing, try to earn the trust of your readers by establishing commonalities with them. One of the ways you can do this is by sharing a personal story that relates to the title of your writing. An example of this is a single child writing about experiences growing up without siblings.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be intriguing, you have to show enough of the main ideas to entice readers. Think of it like movie trailers. They don't tell you the whole story, just enough to pique your interest. But do take note that the skill of intriguing your readers, like making good trailers, is a difficult skill. Deciding how much to share, and what to share is not easy. Here's a fine example from Robert DiYanni's </span><a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-gain-more-from-reading-by-taking-it-all-in-more-slowly?utm_source=pocket_mylist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "How to gain more from your reading" on Psyche.co&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might wonder how to increase your enjoyment of literary works, how you might amplify literature's value, and savour more fully the pleasures of language and form, of idea and insight that works of literature offer. In the following villanelle, I suggest how you might begin.</span></em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I think an easy hack is to show the outline of your key points right after your introductory paragraph.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Surprises You</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publication should surprise the readers to satisfy their curiosity. It should provide readers with a new way to look at things. A change in perspective. If a reader is raised to believe that vaccines are harmful to you and an article convinces them otherwise, the article is well written. Good writing also surprises readers by informing them of new ideas or solutions to existing problems. Good writing also provides readers with a finding or discovery that is not well-known. Lastly, good writing surprises readers through the validation of theories and hypotheses.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Makes You Think</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe good writing can encourage an active interaction with the reader. The reader should be questioning themselves as they read the publication. "What did the writer mean by this" "Why is he making these claims?", "Can I expand on the writer's view?" are examples of questions readers should be prompted to think about.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Is Easy To Read</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writing should be easy to read to keep the reader's attention and facilitate a smooth reading experience. If an article is too complex, the message becomes hard to come across. Too easy, and it becomes predictable and boring. Finding the right balance requires practice and experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Makes It Easy To Spread The Message</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, all written works aim to deliver key messages. Readers should be able to share those key messages of the publication with their friends. A way to do this is to craft pithy sentences. Easily quotable sentences. An example of this is "</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where people aren't having any fun, they seldom produce good work.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">" - David Ogilvy, Confessions of an Advertising Man. Another way to hammer down on a key message is to repeat it throughout the publication.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;To recap, good writing has:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has a captivating introduction.</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprises you</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makes you think</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is easy to read</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makes it easy to spread the message</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These traits of good publication I've identified are unique to me. They are my thoughts. You might agree or disagree with it. But I do hope this blog post inspires you to be more analytical when you read something you enjoy.</span></p>
